# tools
Overview
The tools platform has been created in nwjs (Node Webkits) to create a desktop application for making tools.

Instalation
To get this working you will need to download nwjs @ http://nwjs.io/. I am using the SDK but I belive that the normal version will work.
Once download you need to install/extract it to any location on your computer
To run the program you need to put the following into the command line
"/path/to/nwjs/install/nw /path/to/the/tools/folder/."
If you cd to ./snowranger/tools/tools/ you will only need a '.' instead of the entire path.
You can see a run.cmd(widnows) and run.sh(linux) for reference on how this is done.
